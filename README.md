# Adjacency List 
Here are my implementations of an adjacency list to represent a undirected graph.
I implemented using a vector of lists. There are lots of comments as I created this to learn!
## Current functionality (All Compiled)
* Add edge
* Print graph 
* BFS 

## Planned functionality 
* Add DFS 
* Add weighted option to graph
* Better GUI for playing around 
* Read in graphs from a file
